Description
-----

This project consists of a robot with two mode (Remote-Controlled & Self-Controlled).

##### Remote-Controlled Mode :

The robot can be controlled by an android app with Bluetooth connection. There are options for changing eyes and mouth. Arrow keys for moving the robot to four directions. A Remote/Auto control Button in the middle of arrow keys.

##### Self-Controlled Mode :

In Auto mode, robot finds it way by using Ultra sonic sensor.
