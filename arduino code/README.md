This Robot has two modes : Self-controlled and Remote-controlled.

Remote-controlled : In this mode, we can control the robot by using android app and Bluetooth. There are buttons for changing eyes and mouth, and arrow keys for moving the robot. When You press a button, a command is sent to the arduino via bluetooth communication. 

Self-controlled : In the center of arrow keys, there is an Auto/Remote button. By pressing it You can shift between these two modes. In Auto mode arrow keys are disabled and the robot will find its way by using Ultrasonic sensor. 

##### Note : The amount of delays are set based on the size and the speed of my robot, so you may need to costomize it.
